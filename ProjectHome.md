Pandora's Box it's an Ultima Online utility for building and administrate shards created by Arya.
Pandora's Box 3 will have support for the new Ultima Online expansion, Mondain's Legacy, and will be compiled with 3.5 Net Framework.
We also try to improve the code to have better stability and performance.

Status = Release 4.

Release = 3.0.0.5

Update: Now you need at least the 3.5 framework due to some code improvements.

News:

I think soon i'll start to code again for Pandora's Box, too much time has passed since updating this wonderful tool.
Also now i have tons of other things to do but... i'll try to make my best to update it and fix all bugs.
